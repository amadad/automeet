# Caregiving in America: Current State, Challenges, and Government Support

In 2024, caregiving in America faces a significant crisis marked by financial strain and a shortage of professional caregivers. The "2024 State of Caregiving Report" by A Place for Mom highlights the urgent need for increased support for families caring for aging parents. The caregiving landscape is characterized by immense financial burdens, with families spending over 25% of their income on care needs, a statistic that illustrates the breakdown of America's care economy, costing the country billions in lost GDP annually. In the US, challenges faced by caregivers include financial strains, mental health issues, time management, and a lack of support for those who assume unpaid caregiving roles. These challenges have been exacerbated by inadequate professional caregiver availability, which forces family members to take on caregiving duties, often at the expense of their own careers and personal well-being.

Federal, state, and local efforts are underway to improve the caregiving infrastructure. Proposed initiatives include expanding Medicare to cover home care services, establishing ombudsman programs for caregiving support, and introducing caregiver tax credits and paid leave. The US government has also been active in enhancing support for caregivers. The Department of Health and Human Services reports ongoing implementation of a national strategy to support family caregivers, focusing on providing the needed resources and support. Key government programs include the Alzheimer's Caregiver Support Act of 2024 and expanded assistance programs for family caregivers of veterans, among others.
